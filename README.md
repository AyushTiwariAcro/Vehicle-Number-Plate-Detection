## Overview

## Overview

This repository implements an automated system for detecting vehicle number plates from images (or video frames).It uses classical image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, edge detection, and contour detection with **OpenCV** to identify the region of the number plate.  
The detected plate region is then cropped and can be passed on to an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine for further recognition of the alphanumeric characters.

---

## Features

- Detects number plates in images.  
- Crops out the region of plate.  
- Handles different lighting / angles (if supported).  
- (Optional) Supports multiple formats/environments.  
- (Optional) Real-time detection from video.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- (If used) NumPy, Pandas  
- (If used) Deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch (specify)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for prototyping)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyushTiwariAcro/Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection.git
   cd Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux / Mac
   # .\venv\Scripts\activate    # on Windows

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


  
  If there is no requirements file, dependencies may include:

   • opencv-python
  
   • numpy
 
   • (other libraries you’ve used)

## Usage
Describe how to run the code:


  ```bash
  python detect_plate.py --image path/to/image.jpg
  # or
  python detect_plate.py --video path/to/video.mp4
  # Or use the notebook
  jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
